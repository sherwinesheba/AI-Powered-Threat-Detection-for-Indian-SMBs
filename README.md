AI-Powered Threat Detection System

This README.md file serves as the primary documentation for the AI-driven cybersecurity platform, outlining its purpose, setup, and operational guidelines for small and medium businesses in India. It follows standard Markdown formatting to ensure readability on platforms like GitHub, covering essential sections for developers and users.

Project Description:
The platform is an advanced AI-based system designed to monitor network traffic, detect threats in real-time, and automate responses while minimizing false positives. It integrates machine learning for anomaly detection and natural language processing for report generation, tailored for diverse Indian business environments. Core components include backend services with Flask, database management via PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch, and AI models using TensorFlow and OpenAI GPT-4.

Features:
Real-time threat detection processes network packets in under 5 seconds using Scapy for capture and TensorFlow autoencoders for anomalies. Automated responses, such as IP blocking alerts, occur within 10 seconds, with features like phishing email scanning and ransomware pattern recognition. Additional capabilities encompass vulnerability assessments, security policy recommendations via GPT-4, and a user-friendly dashboard for non-technical users, supporting subscription-based access and email/SMS notifications.

Requirements:
Python 3.8+ is required, along with libraries like Flask, SQLAlchemy, Elasticsearch, TensorFlow, OpenAI, Scapy, and NumPy, listed in a requirements.txt file for easy installation. A PostgreSQL database instance and running Elasticsearch server on localhost:9200 are necessary for data persistence and log analysis. An OpenAI API key and email credentials (e.g., Gmail SMTP) must be provided as environment variables for report generation and alerts.

Installation:
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory, then create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` and activate it using `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows). Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, ensuring PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch are installed and running separately. For development, no additional build steps are needed beyond database initialization.

Setup:
Initialize the PostgreSQL database by running the provided SQL schema in a tool like pgAdmin or via `psql`, creating tables for users, subscriptions, and alerts. Configure environment variables in a .env file or directly, including `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, and `MAIL_PASSWORD` for integrations. Start the Flask application with `python app.py` to create tables automatically via SQLAlchemy and launch the monitoring thread.

Usage:
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000 after logging in or registering via the provided routes, where users can view recent alerts and generate compliance reports. For threat analysis, upload files via /upload_malware or submit email content to /api/analyze_email, triggering detection and alerts. Perform vulnerability scans by posting network ranges to /api/scan_vuln, receiving GPT-4 generated recommendations; the system auto-monitors traffic on startup for real-time detection.

Configuration:
Edit config.py to adjust database URIs, Elasticsearch endpoints, and email settings for production environments, ensuring SECRET_KEY is securely generated. Tune the AnomalyDetector threshold in the model for false positive rates based on your network baseline, and customize signature rules in DetectionEngine for specific threats like Indian phishing patterns. For SMS alerts, integrate a local provider API in the AlertSystem class, maintaining no external threat intelligence as per restrictions.

Deployment:
For production, use Gunicorn as the WSGI server with `gunicorn -w 4 app:app` and deploy via Docker using the provided deploy.sh script, building and running the container with necessary env vars. Host on a VPS or cloud like AWS/Heroku, configuring Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL, while scaling Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL with managed services. Monitor performance to ensure detection under 5 seconds, using tools like supervisor for process management and logging to alerts.log.

Limitations:
The system uses mock implementations for advanced features like full ransomware prevention, requiring real data training for TensorFlow models to achieve minimal false positives in diverse networks. No integration with external threat feeds limits global intelligence, focusing on local signatures suitable for SMBs. Real-time processing assumes low-traffic environments; high-volume networks may need optimization or hardware acceleration.

Contributing:
Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit pull requests with detailed commit messages explaining changes to models or routes. Test contributions locally, including unit tests for detection accuracy, and ensure compliance with tool restrictions like using only specified frameworks. Review contributions focus on security best practices, such as input validation, to maintain data integrity.
